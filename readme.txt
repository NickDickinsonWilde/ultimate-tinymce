1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Support Forum =

Please use my support forum <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">HERE</a> for expedited help.

= The text doesn't wrap at the end of the window and keeps going, creating a slider across the bottom of the window. =
I have found this to be because the line of text being entered has no spacing.  A single line of text, without any spacing, will cause the editor window to "grow".  Insert a space somewhere and the line will break to a new line.  

= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser if you want to use the colorpicker.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.</li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

== Screenshots ==

1. <strong>Shows the two button rows added to the visual editor.</strong>
2. <strong>The visual edit style CSS box.  Easily edit your CSS styles from a visual mode, without any need to know CSS or HTML.</strong>
3. <strong>The attributes box showing the many different possible events you may add.</strong>
4. <strong>Easily create gorgeous tables using only the visual editor.</strong>
5. <strong>The advanced link box.  Here, you can have your links display as javascript popup windows; among other features.</strong>
6. <strong>Screenshot of my new Ultimate Moods editor button.  Insert over fifty different animated .gif's into your blog posts.</strong>
7. <strong>The admin panel where you can select which buttons you would like to include in your editor.</strong>

== Features ==

* Retain div tags, iframe tags, embed tags, object tags, and more.
* Retain P and BR tags, by using a style. (See my support forum for more info).
* Add PHP widgets, which will allow you to run custom PHP code in your widgets.
* Signoff feature.  Do you always "sign" your posts with the same thing?  Now create it once, and insert it using a 7-letter shortcode.
* New animated smilies.  These will be sure to draw some pleasant attention to your blog.
* Now includes an admin panel to choose which buttons you would like to show in your editor.
* Complete control over custom CSS styles using drop-down lists.
* Advanced link and image inserts, including mouseover and mouseout, and even open links in javascript windows... all without writing a single line of code.
* Adds buttons for cut, copy, and paste.
* Adds a button to insert horizontal rows.
* A dropdown list for font-styles.
* A dropdown list for font-size.
* Adds colorpickers for font foreground and background colors.
* Adds anchors, making their usage extremely easy.  (Ever wondered how you click a link and it auto-scrolls you halfway down the page??  Here's how.)
* Includes a grand total of 48 emoticons... and counting.  See them in both your admin panel AND your pages/posts.
* Adds a new row for adding tables and manipulating their properties individually.  Add as many tables as you like, and change the properties of each, without affecting your other tables.

*Simply too many features to list!!

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.3 =
* Added a custom message box which will display on your register/login page. This is available from within the admin panel settings page. Simply "check" the box, enter your message, and it will magically be displayed on your register/login form just above the login box. This can, of course, be styled however you like.
* Added an option to enable the tinymce editor within the post/page excerpt box. Now, you can create your custom excerpts using the power of Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added an option to show the post/page ID in the admin menu for posts and pages. This is extremely helpful if you are using plugins which require you to enter the post or page ID. A HUGE timesaver.
* Added a few more "Save your Selection" buttons, so it's not just one button at the bottom of the page.  It doesn't matter which button your use, they all function the same.  It's more for convenience.
* Be sure to visit my support forum to see usage examples of Ultimate TinyMCE.  It's the best way to follow along with updates, video and image turorials, and knowledgeable community members. http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1
* The direct URL for the new features included in this update is here:  http://www.forum.joshlobe.com/showthread.php?tid=19
* As always, please go back and click "Works" again to help spread this plugin.

= 1.6.2 =
* Added support for div, iframe, object, param, embed, and pre tags.  You can now safely use these tags (and any attributes) while switching between Visual and HTML mode.  Also, they will not be stripped away when you publish a page.
* Incorporated some of the functionality from "TinyMCE Clear".  This allows you to use "clear div" tags and elements.  This option will have to be selected in the admin panel "Ultimate TinyMCE" settings page.  It will also add three new buttons to row 1 of the editor in Visual mode.
* You can now retain P and BR tags, if you use a style.  Please see my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">FORUM</a> for more information about how to use this feature.
* Be sure to check the <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">FORUM</a> anyway.  I have also added some news about newfound Keyboard Shortcuts.
* If you're happy and you know it... please go back and click "works" again for the new version.


= 1.6.1 =
* Added a new options box on the settings page for enabling/disabling two of the advanced features; Advanced Link and Custom Styles.
* These two features will be disabled by default when activating the upgrade.  If you use these features, you must "check" them in the admin panel settings page.
* Leaving these boxes "unchecked" will restore the default WordPress functionality of the insert/edit link button and the styles dropdown list respectively.
* My form only allows 100 submissions per month (free service).  So, if my feedback form doesn't show, you know why.
* Additional testing for compatibility with WordPress 3.3.  No known issues at this time.

= 1.6.0 =
* Added a community support forum for more concentrated and expedited help.  The links can be found in the Ultimate TiynMCE settings panel, or on the active plugins page under Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added a section in the settings page for bloggers.  Read the info, and follow along if you like this plugin.
* Added code templates for my next few planned upgrades.

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed bug where tinymce was adding crazy white space.  I thought my last release had fixed this issue, but apparently it's not ready.
* I could use some extra testers for new versions.  If interested, please contact me using one of the methods on the plugin main download page.  Thanks.

= 1.5.8 =
* Working on ways to make formatting not get stripped by tinymce.  Added default ability of transforming use of the enter key into "&nbsp" characters.  This should help with line spacing when switching between Visual and HTML modes.
* Adjusted various default behaviors of the tinymce initialization process.
* Added Dutch and Finnish Translations.

<strong>New Features:</strong>

* Added ability to use PHP code inside text widgets.
* Added a signoff shortcode feature.  If you always "sign" your posts the same way, this option will allow you to insert it into your editor via a simple shortcode.
* Both of these can be enabled/disabled in the settings menu.

= 1.5.7 =
* Received a few messages regarding the buttons disappearing when activating the plugin.  This was caused by the __construct() function conflicting with other plugins using the same function.  I rewrote the code so the construct function is no longer needed.  This has helped speed up tinymce loading time significantly.
* Added Japanese to the language translations.

= 1.5.6 =

* Changed all text strings to support language localization.  Please contact me if you would like to help with a translation.
* Fixed image paths to support wordpress installations in subdirectories.  Thanks to Redcocker - http://www.near-mint.com/blog/

= 1.5.5 =

* Added functionality to create shortcodes for use within the editor. (Please see the Microsoft Word documentation on the plugin settings page in the admin panel for complete usage instructions).
* Updated the Microsoft Word documentation to include support for iframe's.

= 1.5.4 =

* Added a couple of screencasts and a word document to help with how to use the TinyMCE.  These can be found in the admin panel settings page, under "Additional Resources".
* Added a few advanced featuers to the HR button.  This button will again be un-selected by default.  You will need to re-enable the button in the admin panel.
* Cleaned up some code, and reduced some of the functions into arrays.  This will have a pretty unnoticeable, yet still effective, decrease in tinymce loading time.

= 1.5.3 =

* Added a button for working with embedding audio, video, and flash files.
* Added a custom styles drop-down list... with plans on adding more.  Please let me know what you would like included here.
* Added a form to the admin settings page; please use this form to pass along your ideas to me.

= 1.5.2 =

* I've been working on this one for a while... You're going to love it!!  ULTIMATE MOODS.
* Ultimate Moods will add a new button in your visual editor window.  You will have over fifty, nifty, thrifty little animated smilies to choose from and insert them directly into your posts/pages.
* This little upgrade is sure to bring a new "look and feel" to your blogpages.  It's both FUN and FRESH!!
* Remember you will need to enable the button in the admin panel settings page.
* I'm thinking about working on a paid version which will include hundreds of new animated moods.  Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think.
* Don't forget to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9E5VNRBMVBCS">donate</a> if you can spare a dollar or two ;)  This upgrade took some time, and I'm sure many of you will enjoy.
* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.


= 1.5.1 =

* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Noted the "save" buttons to make aware you must click the save button for each row accordingly.
* Added "settings" link to the plugin page where plugins are listed.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed bug where Row 3 buttons were not saving.

= 1.4 =

* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =

* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.2 =

* Added an admin control where you can choose which buttons you would like to display in the editor.
* Adds an option menu in the admin panel under Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Simply select which buttons you would like to add to your editor.
* Note: All buttons are NOT selected by default on first install.

= 1.1 =

* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
