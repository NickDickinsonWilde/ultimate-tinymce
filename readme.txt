== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.<li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

== Screenshots ==

1. <strong>Shows the two button rows added to the visual editor.</strong>
2. <strong>The visual edit style CSS box.  Easily edit your CSS styles from a visual mode, without any need to know CSS or HTML.</strong>
3. <strong>The attributes box showing the many different possible events you may add.</strong>
4. <strong>Easily create gorgeous tables using only the visual editor.</strong>

6. <strong>Screenshot of my new Ultimate Moods editor button.  Insert over fifty different animated .gif's into your blog posts.</strong>
7. <strong>The admin panel where you can select which buttons you would like to include in your editor.</strong>

* Adds a new row for adding tables and manipulating their properties individually.  Add as many tables as you like, and change the properties of each, without affecting your other tables.

*Simply too many features to list!!

== Changelog ==

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed bug where tinymce was adding crazy white space.  I thought my last release had fixed this issue, but apparently it's not ready.
* I could use some extra testers for new versions.  If interested, please contact me using one of the methods on the plugin main download page.  Thanks.

= 1.5.8 =
* Working on ways to make formatting not get stripped by tinymce.  Added default ability of transforming use of the enter key into "&nbsp" characters.  This should help with line spacing when switching between Visual and HTML modes.
* Adjusted various default behaviors of the tinymce initialization process.
* Added Dutch and Finnish Translations.

<strong>New Features:</strong>

* Added ability to use PHP code inside text widgets.
* Added a signoff shortcode feature.  If you always "sign" your posts the same way, this option will allow you to insert it into your editor via a simple shortcode.
* Both of these can be enabled/disabled in the settings menu.

= 1.5.7 =
* Received a few messages regarding the buttons disappearing when activating the plugin.  This was caused by the __construct() function conflicting with other plugins using the same function.  I rewrote the code so the construct function is no longer needed.  This has helped speed up tinymce loading time significantly.
* Added Japanese to the language translations.

= 1.5.6 =

* Changed all text strings to support language localization.  Please contact me if you would like to help with a translation.
* Fixed image paths to support wordpress installations in subdirectories.  Thanks to Redcocker - http://www.near-mint.com/blog/

= 1.5.5 =

* Added functionality to create shortcodes for use within the editor. (Please see the Microsoft Word documentation on the plugin settings page in the admin panel for complete usage instructions).
* Updated the Microsoft Word documentation to include support for iframe's.

= 1.5.4 =

* Added a couple of screencasts and a word document to help with how to use the TinyMCE.  These can be found in the admin panel settings page, under "Additional Resources".
* Added a few advanced featuers to the HR button.  This button will again be un-selected by default.  You will need to re-enable the button in the admin panel.
* Cleaned up some code, and reduced some of the functions into arrays.  This will have a pretty unnoticeable, yet still effective, decrease in tinymce loading time.

= 1.5.3 =

* Added a button for working with embedding audio, video, and flash files.
* Added a custom styles drop-down list... with plans on adding more.  Please let me know what you would like included here.
* Added a form to the admin settings page; please use this form to pass along your ideas to me.

= 1.5.2 =

* I've been working on this one for a while... You're going to love it!!  ULTIMATE MOODS.
* Ultimate Moods will add a new button in your visual editor window.  You will have over fifty, nifty, thrifty little animated smilies to choose from and insert them directly into your posts/pages.
* This little upgrade is sure to bring a new "look and feel" to your blogpages.  It's both FUN and FRESH!!
* Remember you will need to enable the button in the admin panel settings page.
* I'm thinking about working on a paid version which will include hundreds of new animated moods.  Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think.
* Don't forget to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9E5VNRBMVBCS">donate</a> if you can spare a dollar or two ;)  This upgrade took some time, and I'm sure many of you will enjoy.
* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.


= 1.5.1 =

* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Noted the "save" buttons to make aware you must click the save button for each row accordingly.
* Added "settings" link to the plugin page where plugins are listed.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed bug where Row 3 buttons were not saving.

= 1.4 =

* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =

* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.2 =

* Added an admin control where you can choose which buttons you would like to display in the editor.
* Adds an option menu in the admin panel under Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Simply select which buttons you would like to add to your editor.
* Note: All buttons are NOT selected by default on first install.

= 1.1 =

* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
