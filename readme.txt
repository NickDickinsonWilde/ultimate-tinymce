== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.

     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. There is not an options menu; this is as simple as it gets.  The buttons are added automatically.  Just open any post or page in the visual editor to see your new buttons.

4. If you are updating; no problem.  Just click the automatic update and everything will be done for you.  Since there are no settings to be saved, nothing gets lost.  After updating, the next time you open your editor you will immediately have the new functionality.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The options to save my buttons is acting kind of funny. =

Remember, you must save each row of buttons independently.  This is the only way I could get the code to work.  First select which buttons you would like to include in Row 3, and click Save Options for Row 3.  Then, select the buttons for Row 4 and click Save Options for Row 4.

= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.<li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

== Screenshots ==

3. <strong>The attributes box showing the many different possible events you may add.</strong>
4. <strong>Easily create gorgeous tables using only the visual editor.</strong>

= 1.4 =
* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =
* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.1 =
* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
